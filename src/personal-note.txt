Hi! My name is Parth Patel and I am a full stack developer seeking a coop position. 
I love to learn, cook and improve upon my existing skills, which is what I 
consistently try to do in my free time.

I am fascinated by big data and am aware of its potential for positive, beneficial impact. 
This is why EQ Works excites me. Not only does it have a cutting edge and downright cool product, 
it also holds the power to positively influence the decisions of a large amount of people.

Being able to learn from the innovative people that work there, I believe, would be a great learning 
experience for me as I would get to see innovation taking place first hand. This is why I want to work at EQ Works.
Thank you for your time and I hope to hear back from you.
